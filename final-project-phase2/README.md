Project Architecture & Design Final Architecture: Provide a high-level overview of your design.

Example: "I used a decoupled architecture separating the User Interface (Lightning Components) from the Business Logic (Apex Triggers/Services) to ensure modularity."

Workflow Explanation: Describe the "happy path" of your data.

Example: "When a lead is converted, a custom Apex service handles data mapping and creates the related Opportunity and Contact records automatically."

Approval Workflows: Explain the human-in-the-loop steps.

Example: "Discounts above 20% trigger a multi-step approval process requiring both Sales Manager and Finance Director sign-off."

Reporting/Dashboard Ideas: List how you visualize success.

Example: "I created a dashboard showing 'Weekly Lead Velocity' and 'Conversion Success Rate' to provide stakeholders with actionable insights."

Failure Handling Ideas: Explain how you keep the system stable.

Example: "I implemented try-catch blocks in all Apex services and used Custom Metadata to log error messages, ensuring admins receive immediate email notifications during failures."

Scalability Discussion: Explain how the system handles growth.

Example: "By using asynchronous processing (@future or Queueable Apex) for heavy integrations, I ensured the system remains performant even if transaction volume spikes."

Reflection: Briefly note what you learned.

Example: "This project taught me that design choices made during the build—like avoiding hardcoding and using modular logic—are more important for long-term maintenance than the initial code itself."
