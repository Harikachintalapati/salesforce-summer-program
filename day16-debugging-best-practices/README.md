Common Bug Scenarios
In Salesforce development, I often encounter syntax errors like typos or missing tags in the 
HTML template. Logic errors frequently occur when server-side Apex methods return data that 
the client-side component isn't expecting. I also deal with "Null" or "Undefined" errors when 
accessing object properties before the data has finished loading, as well as race conditions 
where an LWC tries to render before the wire service has completed its data fetch.

Debugging Approach
My process starts by reproducing the issue in a sandbox environment. I use the browser's
developer tools to inspect the console for JavaScript errors and the Network tab to verify the
Apex controller responses. If the issue is complex, I use console.log() statements to trace the 
data flow or implement breakpoints to inspect variable states in real-time. After fixing the root cause, 
I perform a thorough test to ensure the component remains stable and doesn't conflict 
with existing Lightning Page configurations.

Performance Discussion
To ensure high performance, I focus on minimizing redundant calls to the server by utilizing the 
Lightning Data Service (LDS) or caching wire results. I avoid performing heavy calculations or
data transformations inside the renderedCallback hook to prevent performance degradation. 
Additionally, I ensure proper memory management by clearing intervals and removing event
listeners within the disconnectedCallback hook.

LWC Best Practices
I adhere to the principle of "Single Responsibility" by keeping components small and reusable. I 
use @api for public properties, @track for reactive private state, and @wire for efficient data 
binding. I also ensure CSS is encapsulated within the component’s style file to prevent global
styling issues. Most importantly, I prioritize using base Lightning components (like lightning-
datatable or lightning-card) to maintain accessibility standards and consistency across the
Salesforce platform.

Reflection
Debugging is one of the most important skills because it directly correlates to the
maintainability of a Salesforce org. Because Salesforce development involves complex 
interactions between the database, Apex, and the UI, being able to trace an error back to its 
source is vital. It shifts the focus from applying "quick hacks" that lead to technical debt, toward 
writing modular, clean code that is easy to debug and scale for the long term.
